1) how do you divide household chores in your family ? what household chores do you usually do?
    Both my parents work , so we split the household chores equally:
    +) My mother cooks and shops for groceries 
    +) my father cleans the house and does the heavy lifting
    +) my sister does all the laundry, help my mom to perpare the meal
    +) I usually do the washing-up ans take out he rubbish
2)  We have lots of benefits when sharing household chores 
    +) Make your life easier , it not only creates a positive atmosphere but also sets a good example for the children

3)  I like feeding our cat and seeing their eating cheerfully because they make me happy and relax after school time 
    I also like sweeping the house because i fell happy to see my house clean
    I don't like washing the dishes because i often break things when i do the washing up
    I also don't like doing the laundry because i often get wet when i wash the clothes by hand
